# classify-handwritten-digits-using-kNNs
In this project, I implement my own kNN classifier from scratch to classify images of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. I also use the classifier to classify my own digits using Gradio.

## About the Dataset 

The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is one of the most well-known and widely used datasets in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a large collection of handwritten digits that have been normalized and centered in a fixed-size image, making it a benchmark dataset for evaluating image processing systems.

Key Features:

- Dataset Composition: The MNIST dataset contains a total of 70,000 images of handwritten digits.
- Training Set: 60,000 images
- Test Set: 10,000 images
- Image Size: Each image is 28x28 pixels, resulting in a total of 784 pixels per image.
- Grayscale Images: The images are in grayscale, with pixel values ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
- Classes: The dataset includes ten classes, representing the digits 0 through 9.
- Format: The images are provided in a standardized format, with the digits centered and size-normalized.

## About Gradio (the library that I use for testing my own handwritten digits on my kNN implementation)

Gradio is an open-source Python library that allows developers to quickly create and share user interfaces for machine learning models. It provides an intuitive interface for building web-based demos and applications that can showcase the capabilities of machine learning models interactively.

Key Features:

- Ease of Use: Gradio allows for the rapid creation of interactive interfaces with minimal coding.
- Integration: It integrates seamlessly with popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn.
- Real-Time Interaction: Users can interact with models in real-time, making it easier to visualize and understand model predictions and behavior.
- Sharing: Gradio applications can be easily shared via unique URLs, allowing for collaborative development and demonstration.
